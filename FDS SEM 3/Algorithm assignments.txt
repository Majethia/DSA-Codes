5.If false, then check if num2 is greater than num3
	1.If true, then print ‘num2’ as the greatest number.
	2.If false, then print ‘num3’ as the greatest number.
6.End


Find roots of quadratic equation

1.Start
2.Input the value of a, b, c.
3.Calculate k = b*b - 4*a*c.
4.If (d < 0) Display "Roots are Imaginary, 
5.calculater1 = (-b + root(k))/ 2a and r2 =(b + root(k))/ 2a. 
6.else if (d = 0) Display "Roots are Equal" and calculate r1 = r2 = (-b / 2*a)
7.Print r1 and r2.
8.End
