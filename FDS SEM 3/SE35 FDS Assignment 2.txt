Algoritm to find largest number in array

1.Start
2.Take input array from user
3.Make a temperory variable and set it as first element of the array
4.Iterate through the array and if any element is greater than the temperory variable, update its value with the greater value
5.Return the value of temp variable as the result
6.End


Algorithm to Calculate Average of Numbers stored in Array.

1.Start
2.Take input array from user
3.Make a variable sum and set it to zero
4.Iterate over the array and add all the values to sum
5.Return sum as the result
6.End


Algorithm to find the element with highest frequency in a array.

1.Start
2.Make 2 variables, result as first element of list and freq as its frequency (find frequecny using the algorithm after this)
3.Iterate through the array and find every elements frequenct if its larger than the one in freq update the value of freq and result
4.Return the value of result
5.End


Algorithm to find a elements frequency in a array.

1.Start
2.Take input array and the element whose frequency is to be found out.
3.Make variable count and set as 0
4.Iterate over the array and if the value is equal to what was inputed, increase count by 1
5.Return the value of count
6.End
